# lighting-objects
This is a proposal for LWM2M-Compatible objects for lighting and control

These objets were developed in 2015 as a design study to evaluate the applicability of the IPSO/LWM2M data model for more complex models and structures

In order to implement all of the functionality of these objects, a means to create and delete instances of objects and resources is required
